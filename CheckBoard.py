Exercise 26: Check Tic Tac Toe

As you may have guessed, we are trying to build up to a full tic-tac-toe board. 
However, this is significantly more than half an hour of coding, so weâ€™re doing it in pieces.

Today, we will simply focus on checking whether someone has WON a game of Tic Tac Toe, 
    not worrying about how the moves were made.
