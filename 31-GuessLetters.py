Exercise 31: Guess Letters

Letâ€™s continue building Hangman. 

In the game of Hangman, a clue word is given by the program 
	that the player has to guess, letter by letter. 

The player guesses one letter at a time until the entire word has been guessed. 
(In the actual game, the player can only guess 6 letters incorrectly before losing).
