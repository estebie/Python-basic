Exercise 21: Write to file

Take the code from the How To Decode A Website exercise 
	(if you didnâ€™t do it or just want to play with some different code, use the code from the solution), 
	and instead of printing the results to a screen, 
	write the results to a txt file. 

In your code, just make up a name for the file you are saving to.

Done in exercise 19
