Exercise 35: Birthday Months

In the previous exercise we saved information about famous scientistsâ€™ names 
	and birthdays to disk. In this exercise, load that JSON file from disk, 
	extract the months of all the birthdays, and count how many scientists 
	have a birthday in each month.

Your program should output something like:

{
	'May': 3,
	'November': 2,
	'December': 1
}
